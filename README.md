# ChatGPT Fine-Tuning Guide

## Introduction
This repository provides an example on how to fine-tune the ChatGPT model for a specific task. 

It draws inspiration from the [GrammarGPT project](https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/GrammarGPT). 

You're free to modify the input files as per your requirements.

## Steps to Fine-Tune Your Model

### 1. Setup

Ensure you have the latest OpenAI package installed (version `openai>=1.3.7`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Preparation

Prepare your custom training data (e.g., `train_data.jsonl`) and validation data (e.g., `valid_data.jsonl`).

**Note:** The size of the input file is currently capped at 50MB. For more details, refer to the [OpenAI documentation on dataset preparation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset).

### 3. Model Training

To train your model, use the `train_model.py` script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

**Important:** In `train_model.py`, ensure that you first upload the custom data to OpenAI. Once the upload is successful, the training will commence. The training process might take several hours, so please be patient.

### 4. Model Testing

To test your fine-tuned model, use the `test_model.py` script:

```bash
python test_model.py
```

**Note:** You need to get the model id before the test.
